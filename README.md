# Outreach: An app to build statisical models for prediction

This app was built to be used in a Year 12 Virtual Taster Day session. The day was organised by the Centre for Mathematical Sciences at the University of Plymouth. The session introduced students to the concept of a statistical model, how to build and assess one, and how to make predictions from the developed model.

The app is available [here](https://sriley3.shinyapps.io/spaceship-titanic/).
